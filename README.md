# A Comparison of Pre-Trained Deep Learning Models for COVID-19 Prediction on Chest X-Ray Images
This study investigates the use of four pre-trained neural network architectures—ResNet50, DenseNet201, MobileNetV2, and InceptionResNetV2—for the automatic detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. The results demonstrate that DenseNet201 and MobileNetV2 achieve the highest performance, with MobileNetV2 requiring the least training time. The findings suggest that these approaches can be used for rapid and accurate COVID-19 detection, offering an alternative to PCR testing.

Key Achievements:
- Successfully compared four pre-trained deep learning architectures (ResNet50, DenseNet201, MobileNetV2, and InceptionResNetV2) for COVID-19 detection using chest X-ray images.
- Employed cross-validation and advanced methods such as data augmentation to reduce overfitting and enhance model generalization.
- Achieved high performance with DenseNet201 and MobileNetV2, both reaching an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score of 0.95.
- Identified MobileNetV2 as the optimal model for rapid training, with significantly shorter training time (74.45 seconds) compared to other models.
